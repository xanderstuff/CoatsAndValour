## Entities
- [ ] Field Cannon

    - [ ] powder charge (consumes 1) (EMPTY -> HAS_POWDER)
    - [ ] block rammer (infinite use) (HAS_POWDER -> HAS_COMPACTED_POWDER)
    - [ ] cannon ball (roundshot/shellshot/caseshot) (consumes 1) (HAS_COMPACTED_POWDER -> HAS_PROJECTILE)
    - [ ] block rammer, again (infinite use) (HAS_PROJECTILE -> READY_TO_FIRE)
    - [ ] flint & steel (-1 durability) (READY_TO_FIRE -> EMPTY)
    - [ ] countdown timer to control how long it takes to move from one state to the next (different amounts for each state)
  - [ ] store which cannon ball type is currently loaded
  - [ ] fire projectiles (depends on which cannon ball type is currently loaded)
  - [ ] able to be mounted by Players, use WASD to move (slowly...)
    - [ ] override the typical strafing of A/D keys with left/right rotation instead (see: vanilla boats - client-side movement)
    - [ ] can also be aimed by players (angle up/down) (how should this be controlled?)
  - [ ] store self-destruct chance (residue explosives build up after each use)
  - [ ] self-destruct explosion (use normal explosion particles, see: TNT)
  - [ ] can be cleaned using a Sponge to reset self-destruct chance
  - [ ] can be leaded to horses, camels, or boats* to move (* how should it interact with water?)

## Mechanics
- [ ] bleeding
  - [ ] slowly loose health over time
  - [x] status effect icon
  - [ ] force disable particles
  - [ ] custom blood dripping particle
  - [x] ~~add gangrene after some time~~ (edit: this simple behaviour is incorrect. It should be replaced with the todo item below)
  - [ ] after removing the bleeding effect (with bandages), if the player does not heal back to full health after X time (config default=1200 ticks), they then get gangrene
  - [x] (fix) missing status effect translation string
  - [x] (fix) don't spam component update packets
- [ ] gangrene
  - [x] increases level over time
  - [ ] once level reaches the maximum hp, the entity dies
  - [x] status effect icon
  - [x] health bar icon overlay
  - [x] (fix) missing status effect translation string
  - [x] (fix) don't spam component update packets
- [ ] customizable nation uniforms
  - [ ] Textile Block
    - [ ] interactable block (see `CraftingTableBlock`)
    - [ ] GUI (perhaps use OwO-lib?)
      - [ ] player preview (same as player inventory)
      - [ ] input and output nation uniform item slot
      - [ ] style selector
      - [ ] primary, secondary, and tertiary dye color inputs
      - [ ] additional customization controls
  - [ ] Nation Uniforms have different main styles (stored in NBT. Probably an Enum)
  - [ ] Nation Uniforms can be dyed (stored in NBT, see leather armour)
    - [ ] the texture used to render this armour is colored in some sections, but not others (see leather armour)

- Better Combat
  - [ ] Cutlass, Pistol swords, Sabres use the cutlass preset
- Mod Menu
  - [x] add proper mod icon
